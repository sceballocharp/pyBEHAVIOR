# Behavior Rules

This document describes trial start, scoring, and reward logic in `pyBEHAVIOR_v7.py`.

## Shared Concepts

Trials are created by `create_trial()` and stored in `self.trial_rows`. The currently active trial is tracked by:

- `active_trial_index`
- `active_trial_start_s`
- `active_trial_end_s`
- `active_high_start_s`
- `active_crossing_total_s`
- `active_lick_count`
- `active_left_lick_count`
- `active_right_lick_count`
- `active_choice_side`
- `active_reward_decided`
- `active_reward_sent`
- `active_trial_base_iti_s`
- `active_trial_extra_timeout_s`

Task state is reset by `clear_active_trial()`.

`check_trigger()` is the central dispatcher for non-lever tasks. Lever has a dedicated `check_lever_trigger_sample()` path.

## Trial Outcome Fields

Each `TrialLog.csv` row has:

- `HIT`
- `MISS`
- `CR`
- `FA`
- `ResultType`

Use these fields for behavioral outcome. Reward delivery is related but not identical, especially with `Pavlov`.

## Classic Go/No-Go

Task identifier:

```text
TaskType=ClassicGoNoGo
```

### Trial Start

Classic trial creation uses `start_classic_trial()`.

For `TriggerTypeDropDown=IRFork`:

- Trial starts on an upward threshold crossing.
- After a trial and ITI, the signal must be seen below threshold before the next upward crossing can start a new trial.

For `TriggerTypeDropDown=Lick`:

- Trial starts when the ITI has elapsed.
- Lick threshold crossings are counted during the active response window.
- A lick that starts during ITI is not meant to be the required trial-start event.

For classic Go/No-Go, `ResponseWindow_s` starts at trial start. The sound is played inside that window, so the protocol preview should not draw the response/reward window as starting after sound offset. `RewardDelay_s` delays the response-contingent GO reward from the HIT time; it does not delay or move the scoring window.

### IRFork Scoring

Functions:

- `evaluate_active_trial(sample_time_s)`
- `finish_active_trial(trial_end_s)`
- `add_active_high_interval(crossing_end_s)`
- `get_active_crossing_total(sample_time_s)`
- `get_hit_threshold_s()`

For GO trials, HIT requires total time above threshold to reach:

```text
ResponseWindow_s * HITThreshold_percent / 100
```

For no-go trials, reaching that same threshold is FA; otherwise CR.

### Lick Scoring

Functions:

- `add_active_lick()`
- `evaluate_active_lick_trial(row)`
- `finish_active_lick_trial(row, trial_end_s)`

For GO trials, HIT requires:

```text
active_lick_count >= Minlickcount
```

For no-go trials, reaching `Minlickcount` is FA; otherwise CR.

### Reward Rules

`maybe_send_go_reward()` sends response-contingent rewards for GO HITs using `RewardGo`.

`maybe_send_pavlov_reward()` can reward GO trials independently of behavior using `Pavlov`.

Current contract:

- `RewardGo` applies after a GO HIT.
- In classic Go/No-Go, `RewardDelay_s` sends that GO HIT reward at `HIT_time + RewardDelay_s`.
- `Pavlov` applies to GO trials regardless of HIT/MISS.
- `Pavlov=1` rewards every GO trial.
- HIT/MISS scoring remains behavioral even when Pavlov reward is delivered.
- No-go trials are not Pavlov rewarded.

## Lever

Task identifier:

```text
TaskType=Lever
```

Main functions:

- `check_lever_trigger_sample(sample_time_s, value, threshold)`
- `start_active_lever_trial(trigger_time_s, iti_s)`
- `evaluate_active_lever_trial(sample_time_s)`
- `finish_active_lever_trial(trial_end_s, success, hold_end_s=None)`
- `is_lever_release_success(release_time_s)`

### Trial Start

Lever trials require:

1. ITI has elapsed.
2. Lever signal has been observed below `LeverThreshold`.
3. New upward crossing occurs.
4. Signal remains above threshold for `LeverStartDebounce_s`.

The trial trigger time remains the original upward crossing time, not the later debounce-confirmation sample.

### Simple Hold Mode

When:

```text
LeverReqRelBonus=0
LeverReqRelWindow=0
```

Reward logic is triggered once the signal has remained above threshold for `LeverHoldTime_s`.

### Press-Hold-Release Mode

When:

```text
LeverReqRelBonus=1
```

The animal must release after a valid hold. Release is accepted after the signal has stayed below threshold for `LeverReleaseDebounce_s`.

The current success check in `is_lever_release_success()` uses the lower edge of the release window:

```text
hold_s >= LeverHoldTime_s - LeverReleaseWindow_s
```

Reward size then depends on where release happened:

```text
LeverHoldTime_s - LeverReleaseWindow_s <= hold_s <= LeverHoldTime_s + LeverReleaseWindow_s
```

This target window sends three reward pulses total. Releases later than the upper edge still count as HIT but send the normal single reward pulse. The default release window is `0.25` s.

### Window-Only Release Mode

With `LeverReqRelWindow=1`, a release is successful only when:

```text
LeverHoldTime_s <= hold_s <= LeverHoldTime_s + LeverReleaseWindow_s
```

For a 1 s target and 0.25 s window, 1–1.25 s inclusive is HIT; earlier and later releases are MISS. A HIT gets one reward opportunity, subject to `RewardGo` and enabled output. Reaching the target while still holding does not score HIT or send reward. The trial ends on confirmed release, even after the upper limit. Scoring uses the initial downward crossing, not the later debounce confirmation. Short dips retain the existing debounce behavior.

The new flag defaults to 0. Both release flags off selects simple hold. GUI controls are mutually exclusive; importing both flags as 1 selects window-only and reports the conflict. Existing bonus timing and reward counts are unchanged.

### Lever Sound Playback

`play_next_lever_sound()` plays the configured lever sound and can repeat during a held lever state using `lever_sound_gap_s`.

## DMTS

Task identifier:

```text
TaskType=DMTS
```

Main functions:

- `start_active_dmts_trial()`
- `update_active_dmts_trial()`
- `finish_active_dmts_response()`
- `finish_active_dmts_reward_period()`
- `finish_active_dmts_miss()`
- `finish_active_dmts_timeline()`
- `choose_dmts_trial_sound_ids()`

### Trial Structure

DMTS timing is:

```text
sample sound
delay
test sound
response window
reward delay
reward period / final scoring
```

Match trials use the same sample and test sound ID. Non-match trials use different IDs. When `DMTSRandomMatchTrials=1`, IDs are chosen from `DMTSSoundIds`.

### Response Modes

DMTS can use either:

- IRFork time-above-threshold percentage.
- Lick count.

The response window starts after the test sound. For IRFork DMTS, if the fork event ends before the test sound, the trial stops as MISS after `DMTSForkGrace_s`.

### DMTS Outcomes

At the reward-period decision:

| Trial relation | Response met | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sample == test | yes | HIT |
| sample == test | no | MISS |
| sample != test | no | CR |
| sample != test | yes | FA |

Only HIT sends reward through `maybe_send_go_reward()`. FA can add the no-go timeout.

## tAC

Task identifier:

```text
TaskType=tAC
```

tAC is a two-alternative choice task with no fork/IR requirement. The trial starts automatically when the ITI has elapsed. The first closed-loop sequence value is treated as the left-correct sound and the second value as the right-correct sound.

Main functions:

- `start_tac_trial()`
- `start_active_tac_trial()`
- `check_tac_sample()`
- `add_active_tac_lick()`
- `evaluate_active_tac_trial()`
- `finish_active_tac_trial()`

### tAC Trial Start

After `next_trial_allowed_time_s`, `check_tac_sample()` starts the next trial immediately. It does not wait for an IRFork crossing and does not require an animal-present signal.

### tAC Choice Scoring

Left and right licks are read from independent channels:

```text
TACLeftChannel=ai0
TACRightChannel=ai1
```

Each side has its own threshold:

```text
TACLeftThreshold
TACRightThreshold
```

The first side to reach `TACMinlickcount` during `ResponseWindow_s` becomes the choice.

| Correct side | Chosen side | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| left | left | HIT |
| left | right | FA |
| right | right | HIT |
| right | left | FA |
| left/right | no choice | MISS |

Correct choices use `maybe_send_go_reward()` with `RewardGo` and `RewardDelay_s`. Wrong choices add the `PunishNoGoFA` timeout.

tAC uses side-specific reward outputs:

- Left-correct HIT: `Device/port2/line6`
- Right-correct HIT: `Device/port2/line7`

The GUI `Device` value supplies the device name, for example `Dev1/port2/line6` and `Dev1/port2/line7`.

## tAC Pretraining

Task identifier:

```text
TaskType=tACPretraining
```

tAC pretraining is an event-based shaping mode for exploration. It does not present sounds, does not wait for ITI, and does not open a response window. It continuously watches the left and right lick channels.

Main functions:

- `check_tac_pretraining_sample()`
- `finish_tac_pretraining_sequence()`

The rule is:

1. Wait for an upward crossing on either `TACLeftChannel` or `TACRightChannel`.
2. Store the first lick side and time.
3. If the opposite side licks next, send reward to the first side.
4. `left -> right` sends left/default reward on `Device/port2/line6`.
5. `right -> left` sends right reward on `Device/port2/line7`.
6. Log one `TrialLog.csv` event as `tAC-pretraining`, `ResultType=HIT`, and `choice_side=<first>-then-<second>`.
7. Reset immediately to wait for the next first lick.

Repeating the same side updates the stored first lick and keeps waiting for the opposite side. `MaxTrials` acts as a maximum reward-event count; `0` means unlimited. `PlaySound` is forced off for this task at runtime.

## Reward Output

`send_output_pulse()` controls the reward digital outputs. Left/default rewards use `Device/port2/line6`; right rewards use `Device/port2/line7`. It also records pulses for plotting and export through `record_trigger_pulse()`.

`trigger_output_on_crossing` must be enabled for behavioral rewards to physically send pulses.

Manual GUI reward controls call the same output path:

- **Left Reward** sends one left/default pulse.
- **Right Reward** sends one right pulse.
- **100 Left** sends a train of 100 left/default pulses.
- **100 Right** sends a train of 100 right pulses.

## Extension Notes

- Do not update GUI widgets directly from behavior logic running in the acquisition thread; use `plot_queue`.
- Keep trial creation in `create_trial()` so CSV and parameter rows remain synchronized.
- If adding a new outcome or reward path, decide separately whether it changes behavior scoring, reward delivery, or both.
- For any new task, implement explicit start, update, finish, and clear behavior rather than spreading state changes across unrelated functions.
